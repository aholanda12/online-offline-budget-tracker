# Online/Offline Budget Tracker

## Description
This application allows users to input data surrounding their budget. A user will be able to both add and subtract money from their budget, labeling each transaction as they see fit. This information is tracked and demonstrated on a graph that fluctuates with every new transaction put in. This tracker can be used both online and offline. Transactions that are entered offline will be read and rendered with previous transactions when the app goes online again.
